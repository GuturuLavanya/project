    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to structure web pages and their content. It essentially provides the foundation upon which websites are built, defining the structure and layout of text, images, and other elements displayed in a web browser. </p>
    <br>
    <h1>What is an HTML Element?</h1>
    <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:</p>
<h1>What is HTML attribute?</h1>
<p>
    <pre>
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
</pre>

<h1>What is Absolute path and Relative path</h1>
<p>There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:<p>
<p>
1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".</p>
<p>2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".</p>
